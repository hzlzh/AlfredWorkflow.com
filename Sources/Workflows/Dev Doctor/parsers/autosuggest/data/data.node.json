Backwards compatibility should not be expected. Stability: 1 - Experimental This feature was introduced recently, and may change or be removed in future versions.  Please try it out and provide feedback. If it addresses a use-case that is important to you, tell the node core team. Stability: 2 - Unstable The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable. Backwards-compatibility will be maintained if reasonable. Stability: 3 - Stable The API has proven satisfactory, but cleanup in the underlying code may cause minor changes.  Backwards-compatibility is guaranteed.

Package manager programs such as dpkg, rpm, and npm will hopefully find it possible to build native packages from Node modules without modification.   Below we give a suggested directory structure that could work:   Let&#39;s say that we wanted to have the folder at \/usr\/lib\/node\/&lt;some-package&gt;\/&lt;some-version&gt; hold the contents of a specific version of a package.   Packages can depend on one another. In order to install package foo, you may have to install a specific version of package bar.  The bar package may itself have dependencies, and in some cases, these dependencies may even collide or form cycles.   Since Node looks up the realpath of any modules it loads (that is, resolves symlinks), and then looks for their dependencies in the node_modules folders as described above, this situation is very simple to resolve with the following architecture:    \/usr\/lib\/node\/foo\/1.2.3\/ - Contents of the foo package, version 1.2.3. \/usr\/lib\/node\/bar\/4.3.2\/ - Contents of the bar package that foo depends on. \/usr\/lib\/node\/foo\/1.2.3\/node_modules\/bar - Symbolic link to \/usr\/lib\/node\/bar\/4.3.2\/. \/usr\/lib\/node\/bar\/4.3.2\/node_modules\/* - Symbolic links to the packages that bar depends on.  Thus, even if a cycle is encountered, or if there are dependency conflicts, every module will be able to get a version of its dependency that it can use.   When the code in the foo package does require(&#39;bar&#39;), it will get the version that is symlinked into \/usr\/lib\/node\/foo\/1.2.3\/node_modules\/bar. Then, when the code in the bar package calls require(&#39;quux&#39;), it&#39;ll get the version that is symlinked into \/usr\/lib\/node\/bar\/4.3.2\/node_modules\/quux.   Furthermore, to make the module lookup process even more optimal, rather than putting packages directly in \/usr\/lib\/node, we could put them in \/usr\/lib\/node_modules\/&lt;name&gt;\/&lt;version&gt;.  Then node will not bother looking for missing dependencies in \/usr\/node_modules or \/node_modules.   In order to make modules available to the node REPL, it might be useful to also add the \/usr\/lib\/node_modules folder to the $NODE_PATH environment variable.

The module_name needs to match the filename of the final binary (minus the .node suffix).   The source code needs to be built into hello.node, the binary Addon. To do this we create a file called binding.gyp which describes the configuration to build your module in a JSON-like format. This file gets compiled by node-gyp.   {   &quot;targets&quot;: [     {       &quot;target_name&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;,       &quot;sources&quot;: [ &quot;hello.cc&quot; ]     }   ] } The next step is to generate the appropriate project build files for the current platform. Use node-gyp configure for that.   Now you will have either a Makefile (on Unix platforms) or a vcxproj file (on Windows) in the build\/ directory. Next invoke the node-gyp build command.   Now you have your compiled .node bindings file! The compiled bindings end up in build\/Release\/.   You can now use the binary addon in a Node project hello.js by pointing require to the recently built hello.node module:   var addon = require(&#39;.\/build\/Release\/hello&#39;);  console.log(addon.hello()); \/\/ &#39;world&#39; Please see patterns below for further information or  https:\/\/github.com\/arturadib\/node-qt for an example in production."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_addon_patterns","title":"Addon patterns","description":"Below are some addon patterns to help you get started.

When dealing with TCP streams or the file system, it&#39;s necessary to handle octet streams. Node has several strategies for manipulating, creating, and consuming octet streams.   Raw data is stored in instances of the Buffer class. A Buffer is similar to an array of integers but corresponds to a raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap. A Buffer cannot be resized.   The Buffer class is a global, making it very rare that one would need to ever require(&#39;buffer&#39;).   Converting between Buffers and JavaScript string objects requires an explicit encoding method.  Here are the different string encodings.    &#39;ascii&#39; - for 7 bit ASCII data only.  This encoding method is very fast, and will strip the high bit if set. Note that when converting from string to buffer, this encoding converts a null character (&#39;\\0&#39; or &#39;\\u0000&#39;) into 0x20 (character code of a space). If you want to convert a null character into 0x00, you should use &#39;utf8&#39;.  &#39;utf8&#39; - Multibyte encoded Unicode characters. Many web pages and other document formats use UTF-8.  &#39;utf16le&#39; - 2 or 4 bytes, little endian encoded Unicode characters. Surrogate pairs (U+10000 to U+10FFFF) are supported.  &#39;ucs2&#39; - Alias of &#39;utf16le&#39;.  &#39;base64&#39; - Base64 string encoding.  &#39;binary&#39; - A way of encoding raw binary data into strings by using only the first 8 bits of each character. This encoding method is deprecated and should be avoided in favor of Buffer objects where possible. This encoding will be removed in future versions of Node.  &#39;hex&#39; - Encode each byte as two hexadecimal characters.   A Buffer object can also be used with typed arrays.  The buffer object is cloned to an ArrayBuffer that is used as the backing store for the typed array.  The memory of the buffer and the ArrayBuffer is not shared.   NOTE: Node.js v0.8 simply retained a reference to the buffer in array.buffer instead of cloning it.   While more efficient, it introduces subtle incompatibilities with the typed arrays specification.  ArrayBuffer#slice() makes a copy of the slice while Buffer#slice() creates a view."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_stream","title":"Stream","description":"A stream is an abstract interface implemented by various objects in Node.  For example a request to an HTTP server is a stream, as is stdout. Streams are readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of [EventEmitter][]   You can load the Stream base classes by doing require(&#39;stream&#39;). There are base classes provided for Readable streams, Writable streams, Duplex streams, and Transform streams."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_compatibility","title":"Compatibility","description":"In earlier versions of Node, the Readable stream interface was simpler, but also less powerful and less useful.    Rather than waiting for you to call the read() method, &#39;data&#39; events would start emitting immediately.  If you needed to do some I\/O to decide how to handle data, then you had to store the chunks in some kind of buffer so that they would not be lost. The pause() method was advisory, rather than guaranteed.  This meant that you still had to be prepared to receive &#39;data&#39; events even when the stream was in a paused state.  In Node v0.10, the Readable class described below was added.  For backwards compatibility with older Node programs, Readable streams switch into &quot;old mode&quot; when a &#39;data&#39; event handler is added, or when the pause() or resume() methods are called.  The effect is that, even if you are not using the new read() method and &#39;readable&#39; event, you no longer have to worry about losing &#39;data&#39; chunks.   Most programs will continue to function normally.  However, this introduces an edge case in the following conditions:    No &#39;data&#39; event handler is added. The pause() and resume() methods are never called.  For example, consider the following code:   \/\/ WARNING!  BROKEN! net.createServer(function(socket) {    \/\/ we add an &#39;end&#39; method, but never consume the data   socket.on(&#39;end&#39;, function() {     \/\/ It will never get here.     socket.end(&#39;I got your message (but didnt read it)\\n&#39;);   });  }).listen(1337); In versions of node prior to v0.10, the incoming message data would be simply discarded.  However, in Node v0.10 and beyond, the socket will remain paused forever.   The workaround in this situation is to call the resume() method to trigger &quot;old mode&quot; behavior:   \/\/ Workaround net.createServer(function(socket) {    socket.on(&#39;end&#39;, function() {     socket.end(&#39;I got your message (but didnt read it)\\n&#39;);   });    \/\/ start the flow of data, discarding it.   socket.resume();  }).listen(1337); In addition to new Readable streams switching into old-mode, pre-v0.10 style streams can be wrapped in a Readable class using the wrap() method."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_crypto","title":"Crypto","description":"Stability: 2 - Unstable; API changes are being discussed for future versions.

For example, if you currently use the default arguments to the Sign class, and then pass the results to the Verify class, without ever inspecting the data, then it will continue to work as before.  Where you once got a binary string and then presented the binary string to the Verify object, you&#39;ll now get a Buffer, and present the Buffer to the Verify object.   However, if you were doing things with the string data that will not work properly on Buffers (such as, concatenating them, storing in databases, etc.), or you are passing binary strings to the crypto functions without an encoding argument, then you will need to start providing encoding arguments to specify which encoding you&#39;d like to use.

To use this module do require(&#39;fs&#39;). All the methods have asynchronous and synchronous forms.   The asynchronous form always take a completion callback as its last argument. The arguments passed to the completion callback depend on the method, but the first argument is always reserved for an exception. If the operation was completed successfully, then the first argument will be null or undefined.   When using the synchronous form any exceptions are immediately thrown. You can use try\/catch to handle exceptions or allow them to bubble up.   Here is an example of the asynchronous version:   var fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);  fs.unlink(&#39;\/tmp\/hello&#39;, function (err) {   if (err) throw err;   console.log(&#39;successfully deleted \/tmp\/hello&#39;); }); Here is the synchronous version:   var fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);  fs.unlinkSync(&#39;\/tmp\/hello&#39;) console.log(&#39;successfully deleted \/tmp\/hello&#39;); With the asynchronous methods there is no guaranteed ordering. So the following is prone to error:   fs.rename(&#39;\/tmp\/hello&#39;, &#39;\/tmp\/world&#39;, function (err) {   if (err) throw err;   console.log(&#39;renamed complete&#39;); }); fs.stat(&#39;\/tmp\/world&#39;, function (err, stats) {   if (err) throw err;   console.log(&#39;stats: &#39; + JSON.stringify(stats)); }); It could be that fs.stat is executed before fs.rename. The correct way to do this is to chain the callbacks.   fs.rename(&#39;\/tmp\/hello&#39;, &#39;\/tmp\/world&#39;, function (err) {   if (err) throw err;   fs.stat(&#39;\/tmp\/world&#39;, function (err, stats) {     if (err) throw err;     console.log(&#39;stats: &#39; + JSON.stringify(stats));   }); }); In busy processes, the programmer is strongly encouraged to use the asynchronous versions of these calls. The synchronous versions will block the entire process until they complete--halting all connections.   Relative path to filename can be used, remember however that this path will be relative to process.cwd().   Most fs functions let you omit the callback argument. If you do, a default callback is used that ignores errors, but prints a deprecation warning.

If any error is encountered during the request (be that with DNS resolution, TCP level errors, or actual HTTP parse errors) an &#39;error&#39; event is emitted on the returned request object.   There are a few special headers that should be noted.    Sending a &#39;Connection: keep-alive&#39; will notify Node that the connection to the server should be persisted until the next request.  Sending a &#39;Content-length&#39; header will disable the default chunked encoding.  Sending an &#39;Expect&#39; header will immediately send the request headers. Usually, when sending &#39;Expect: 100-continue&#39;, you should both set a timeout and listen for the continue event. See RFC2616 Section 8.2.3 for more information.

You can use your own eval function if it has following signature:   function eval(cmd, context, filename, callback) {   callback(null, result); } Multiple REPLs may be started against the same running instance of node.

Other REPL clients may connect through the Unix socket or TCP socket. telnet is useful for connecting to TCP sockets, and socat can be used to connect to both Unix and TCP sockets.   By starting a REPL from a Unix socket-based server instead of stdin, you can connect to a long-running node process without restarting it.

This due to backwards compatibility issues with a deprecated API.   The &#39;stdio&#39; option to child_process.spawn() is an array where each index corresponds to a fd in the child.  The value is one of the following:    &#39;pipe&#39; - Create a pipe between the child process and the parent process. The parent end of the pipe is exposed to the parent as a property on the child_process object as ChildProcess.stdio[fd]. Pipes created for fds 0 - 2 are also available as ChildProcess.stdin, ChildProcess.stdout and ChildProcess.stderr, respectively. &#39;ipc&#39; - Create an IPC channel for passing messages\/file descriptors between parent and child. A ChildProcess may have at most one IPC stdio file descriptor. Setting this option enables the ChildProcess.send() method. If the child writes JSON messages to this file descriptor, then this will trigger ChildProcess.on(&#39;message&#39;).  If the child is a Node.js program, then the presence of an IPC channel will enable process.send() and process.on(&#39;message&#39;). &#39;ignore&#39; - Do not set this file descriptor in the child. Note that Node will always open fd 0 - 2 for the processes it spawns. When any of these is ignored node will open \/dev\/null and attach it to the child&#39;s fd. Stream object - Share a readable or writable stream that refers to a tty, file, socket, or a pipe with the child process. The stream&#39;s underlying file descriptor is duplicated in the child process to the fd that  corresponds to the index in the stdio array. Positive integer - The integer value is interpreted as a file descriptor  that is is currently open in the parent process. It is shared with the child process, similar to how Stream objects can be shared. null, undefined - Use default value. For stdio fds 0, 1 and 2 (in other words, stdin, stdout, and stderr) a pipe is created. For fd 3 and up, the default is &#39;ignore&#39;.  As a shorthand, the stdio argument may also be one of the following strings, rather than an array:    ignore - [&#39;ignore&#39;, &#39;ignore&#39;, &#39;ignore&#39;] pipe - [&#39;pipe&#39;, &#39;pipe&#39;, &#39;pipe&#39;] inherit - [process.stdin, process.stdout, process.stderr] or [0,1,2]  Example:   var spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn;  \/\/ Child will use parent&#39;s stdios spawn(&#39;prg&#39;, [], { stdio: &#39;inherit&#39; });  \/\/ Spawn child sharing only stderr spawn(&#39;prg&#39;, [], { stdio: [&#39;pipe&#39;, &#39;pipe&#39;, process.stderr] });  \/\/ Open an extra fd=4, to interact with programs present a \/\/ startd-style interface. spawn(&#39;prg&#39;, [], { stdio: [&#39;pipe&#39;, null, null, null, &#39;pipe&#39;] }); If the detached option is set, the child process will be made the leader of a new process group.  This makes it possible for the child to continue running  after the parent exits.   By default, the parent will wait for the detached child to exit.  To prevent the parent from waiting for a given child, use the child.unref() method, and the parent&#39;s event loop will not include the child in its reference count.   Example of detaching a long-running process and redirecting its output to a file:    var fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;),      spawn = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).spawn,      out = fs.openSync(&#39;.\/out.log&#39;, &#39;a&#39;),      err = fs.openSync(&#39;.\/out.log&#39;, &#39;a&#39;);   var child = spawn(&#39;prg&#39;, [], {    detached: true,    stdio: [ &#39;ignore&#39;, out, err ]  });   child.unref(); When using the detached option to start a long-running process, the process will not stay running in the background unless it is provided with a stdio configuration that is not connected to the parent.  If the parent&#39;s stdio is inherited, the child will remain attached to the controlling terminal.   There is a deprecated option called customFds which allows one to specify specific file descriptors for the stdio of the child process. This API was not portable to all platforms and therefore removed. With customFds it was possible to hook up the new process&#39; [stdin, stdout, stderr] to existing streams; -1 meant that a new stream should be created. Use at your own risk.   There are several internal options. In particular stdinStream, stdoutStream, stderrStream. They are for INTERNAL USE ONLY. As with all undocumented APIs in Node, they should not be used.

The preferred way to check if node is being run in a TTY context is to check process.stdout.isTTY:   $ node -p -e &quot;Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)&quot; true $ node -p -e &quot;Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)&quot; | cat false"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_tty_isatty_fd","title":"tty.isatty(fd)","description":"Returns true or false depending on if the fd is associated with a terminal."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_tty_setrawmode_mode","title":"tty.setRawMode(mode)","description":"Deprecated.

Each class takes the same options, and is a readable\/writable Stream.   Examples Compressing or decompressing a file can be done by piping an fs.ReadStream into a zlib stream, then into an fs.WriteStream.   var gzip = zlib.createGzip(); var fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;); var inp = fs.createReadStream(&#39;input.txt&#39;); var out = fs.createWriteStream(&#39;input.txt.gz&#39;);  inp.pipe(gzip).pipe(out); Compressing or decompressing data in one step can be done by using the convenience methods.   var input = &#39;.................................&#39;; zlib.deflate(input, function(err, buffer) {   if (!err) {     console.log(buffer.toString(&#39;base64&#39;));   } });  var buffer = new Buffer(&#39;eJzT0yMAAGTvBe8=&#39;, &#39;base64&#39;); zlib.unzip(buffer, function(err, buffer) {   if (!err) {     console.log(buffer.toString());   } }); To use this module in an HTTP client or server, use the accept-encoding on requests, and the content-encoding header on responses.

When you call server.listen(...) in a worker, it serializes the arguments and passes the request to the master process.  If the master process already has a listening server matching the worker&#39;s requirements, then it passes the handle to the worker.  If it does not already have a listening server matching that requirement, then it will create one, and pass the handle to the child.   This causes potentially surprising behavior in three edge cases:    server.listen({fd: 7}) Because the message is passed to the master, file descriptor 7 in the parent will be listened on, and the handle passed to the worker, rather than listening to the worker&#39;s idea of what the number 7 file descriptor references. server.listen(handle) Listening on handles explicitly will cause the worker to use the supplied handle, rather than talk to the master process.  If the worker already has the handle, then it&#39;s presumed that you know what you are doing. server.listen(0) Normally, this will cause servers to listen on a random port.  However, in a cluster, each worker will receive the same &quot;random&quot; port each time they do listen(0).  In essence, the port is random the first time, but predictable thereafter.  If you want to listen on a unique port, generate a port number based on the cluster worker ID.  When multiple processes are all accept()ing on the same underlying resource, the operating system load-balances across them very efficiently.  There is no routing logic in Node.js, or in your program, and no shared state between the workers.  Therefore, it is important to design your program such that it does not rely too heavily on in-memory data objects for things like sessions and login.   Because workers are all separate processes, they can be killed or re-spawned depending on your program&#39;s needs, without affecting other workers.  As long as there are some workers still alive, the server will continue to accept connections.  Node does not automatically manage the number of workers for you, however.  It is your responsibility to manage the worker pool for your application&#39;s needs."}]
